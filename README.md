# hello-world
my first repository
Hello folks.  I'm taking my first shot at building a repository, messing around with branches.  I'm new to coding and I still don't get what github is used for. I'm guessing it's about building a coding library so people can work on projects together and help each other out.  I work as a financial adviser, but I have many ideas when it comes to coding and I would love to learn enough to switch careers and work on the fintech side of things. I would like to work with Founders & Coders to learn more and eventually give back.
